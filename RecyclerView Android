Recycler view in android has been introduced in order to improve efficiency related to network call, It can bind n number of data to listview or Staggered Grid view.
ALGORITHM involved in using Recycler view is as follows
Add a compatible view used for Recycler view in Build.gradle file
Add a recycler view in layout file
Create an Adapter which extends RecyclerView.Adapter<Generic>; the generic being view holder class which binds or holds the data.
Create a layout which inflates List item layout.
We need to override three methods in adapter the first one is onCreateViewHolder which inflates list item layout and returns Viewholder object associated with it.
The second is onBindViewHolder which holds the data for an individual item in list view
The last being getItemCount which returns the length of an array of Arraylist
Finally we need to wire up in UI using LayoutManager class.
setLayoutManager to RecyclerView.
Use an interface in order to handle click listeners for list item.
